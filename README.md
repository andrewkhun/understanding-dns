<h1>Building Intuition for DNS</h1>
This lab showcases the practical application of DNS and provides guidance on its configuration. DNS, or Domain Name System, serves as a naming database facilitating the translation of internet domain names into IP addresses. It plays a crucial role in mapping user-friendly website names to the corresponding IP addresses used by computers to access those sites. As we configure and set up the system, hands-on exercises involving client and domain controller virtual machines will enhance our understanding of DNS.

Please note, that this lab uses the Active Directory Setup lab as a pre-requisite. Although not entirely necessary it is recommended to complete that lab first to move on to this one.
